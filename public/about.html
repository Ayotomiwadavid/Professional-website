                    <p class="text-large">Lease Legal is part of Small Business Advice Network, a company owned by Chris Hutchins, a retired solicitor, set up in 2011, specifically to provide low cost, high quality legal and management advice to small and start up businesses. In that time Chris has become the leading legal services provider on the UK's biggest freelance website <a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/freelancer/business/chris-hutchins-fully-insured-lawyer-and-business-jymqq?ref=buyer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color:#1a1a1a; text-decoration: underline;">here</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-large">Chris offers an incredible service at prices which are about one third of those offered by High Street law firms. He does this by having, almost, no overheads, and working from home – which he's done since the business started. He's quick, reliable and his reviews speak for him <a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/freelancer/business/chris-hutchins-fully-insured-lawyer-and-business-jymqq?ref=buyer#purchases" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color:#1a1a1a; text-decoration: underline;">here</a>.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-title">Our Expertise</h2>
                    <p class="text-large">In addition to dealing with commercial contracts, Chris has a lifetime's experience of property. He was chosen, a few years ago, to edit a text book on land law and conveyancing for a very well know training school and he writes exam questions on the topic for their students. He is, probably, one of the most experienced property lawyers out there and is highly regarded by his peers – to the extent that he gets commissions from other law firms to deal with commercial lease.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-large">When Chris established his business, all those years ago, he also created a network of colleague, to whom he turns when a matter is beyond his experience – he never takes on work with which he has no experience. That network is also now expanding to include lawyers who are expert in providing advice on leases – as a one-man band, Chris cannot undertake all the work which comes his way.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-large">The lawyers who assist Chris will prepare the reports we offer and you will have the ability to discuss that report with the individual who prepared it. In addition, Chris is always available to talk to.</p>
