          <p><strong>Who are we?</strong> - Lease Legal comprises a network of legal professionals who are expert in advising on short commercial leases. The network is led and managed by Chris Hutchins. Chris qualified as a solicitor very many years ago. He retired from High Street practice in 2008 to set up a small law firm designed to help start-ups and SMEs. The firm is the leading provider of legal services on the Uks premier freelance site and Chris has a 4.9 out of 5 feedback on over 550 jobs, he has undertaken on the site.</p>
          
          <p>We don't work like High Street lawyers – we provide simple advice and give it a manner you can understand. We're business people, just like you and try never to act like professional divas. Our work is fully insured and we pride ourselves on providing the best service at the lowest possible cost.</p>
          
          <p><strong>What do we do?</strong> - A commercial lease is a dreadful beast, designed by the landlord to make the tenant pay for everything, whilst doing the absolute minimum. We can't solve that but what we can do is to explain all the pitfalls and traps in the lease, so that you know what you're letting yourself in for.</p>
          
          <p>We do this in two ways:</p>
          <ol style="text-align: left; max-width: 800px; margin: 1rem auto; line-height: 1.8;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">We provide an easy to read, plain English, review of each clause of the lease. It's been designed to be easy to read, unlike most of the stuff you'll see from a High Street lawyer.</li>
            <li>In our premium service, we'll undertake all the "due diligence" (basically a series of in depth questions designed to try to uncover all the traps in the deal) and negotiate the lease direct with the landlord or its lawyer – in simple terms, we'll do the same job as a High Street lawyer but at a much cheaper cost.</li>
